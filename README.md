# Identity V Instrument Auto Player
---
Fork from https://github.com/sabihoshi/GenshinLyreMidiPlayer (you will find a lot of Genshin Impact references in the program since this is what it was originally made for)

This project is modified to be able to play all Identity V instruments automatically using MIDI files (supports piano with and without black notes, harp and flute). For full details about the program check the original repo
